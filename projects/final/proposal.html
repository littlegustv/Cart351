	<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
	<main>
		<section>
			<div class="title">
				<h2>What is your starting topic? What importance does it hold for you? For others? Why is it important to make this topic into an explorable networked space?</h2>
			</div>
			<article>
				<p>How do people (users) behave in relation to each other and a shared space?  This project intends to create a sort of 'simulation' of a public park space, with paths and walkways, as well as more hidden features found through exploration.  Users navigate the world as entirely as  'footprints', which are recorded in time and place and 'shared' with other users, appearing as artifacts in the world.  This serves as the only representation of other user's behavior, but one that I believe could have powerful effects on how people choose to proceed.</p>
				<p>The ways in which the shape and design of a public space influences behavior is something both important and fascinating.  Public places, like streets, parks, squares, etc. have many uses and needs, and accommodate many different people simultaneously, typically without any deliberate coordination between them.  The success or failure of this kind of space depends on its use of its limited resources.  However they are also evolving spaces.  The behavior does not end with a project design, but is informed by the interactions between people.  For example, an confusing intersection can become clear if a large number of people are using it, demonstrating by their presence how to correctly use the space.</p>
				<p>As a virtual place on the web, this project has the potential to bring out the relationship between a space and the people who visit it, as well as the shallow but important relationships among themselves.  The needs of the users are simple and the level of their interactions is highly abstracted.  Hopefully, this pares down the variables and allows for the three-fold relationship (space-person-person) to be seen more clearly.   A more successful result would accommodate diverse interests and behaviors, but even a less successful version would shed light on possible mechanisms for greater success in the future.</p>
			</article>
		</section>
		<section>
			<article>
				<p>The process of user reflection would unfold in a number of steps.  The initial interaction, where a user sees what others have done before them and modifies their own activity accordingly, is the first step.  If they follow a large number of people and discover something interesting, that is one possible result.  Or perhaps they set out alone, in defiance of the common trend.  The user becomes aware of the virtual space, and also of the web in general, as a place populated by other users, often with similar behavior.</p>
				<p>The secondary 'destabilization' can occur by looking into the 'past' and 'future'.  Once the user's time is up, they can then possibly see the results of future users reacting to their own actions, and the effect that it has.  For some, this might be less visible than others (depending on their behavior), but one can imagine a person striking out over untouched snow, then being followed by future users.  Likewise, seeing an evolution of the space before hand might show that the 'trend' they followed was in reality a very recent occurrence.</p>
				<p>Finally, the in-world 'discoverables' would at some level respond to the kinds of user activity around them.  Large amounts of traffic might 'destroy' or 'displace' the object of attention that attracted so much traffic to begin with.  Conversely, some behavior might emerge only at periods of high traffic.  This means that eventually, a large-scale view of the evolution of the space would be needed, and the user will be able to see their part in its changes.</p>

				<h2>How can you use this 'space' to destabilize the users and make them reflect on themselves, their environment and society?</h2>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section>
			<div class="title">
				<h2>Will your 'space' help, challenge, teach, enable collaboration, understanding between user(s)? How and Why?</h2>
			</div>
			<article>
				<p>The level of direct collaboration possible is quite low.  Users cannot directly communicate or even necessarily identify each other, except by the behavior of moving around.  The purpose of this is to put the design of the space into focus, since in many real-life public spaces, while communication is technically possible, it is unlikely.  This is because these spaces are used by people who are strangers to each other, and coexist by shared rules and expectations guided by the design of the space, not by deliberate communication.  This is not necessarily a problem, but it puts the focus on this design, rather than on the intentions of the individual users.</p>
				<p>What is also highlighted is the often neglected relationship between users as 'strangers', unable to make deeper connections.  This is a core part of online (and offline) social interaction, but is rarely explored.  Qualities like popularity are used by some social media systems to rank their content, but rarely is anonymous, low level interaction viewed as a useful part of online life.  Instead it is treated as an accidental, unavoidable phenomenon.</p>
				<p>While this is beyond the scope of this project, the attitude that anonymous interaction is (at best) an unfortunate necessity means that spaces for this kind of interaction are poorly designed.  This allows the environment of 'anonymous interaction' to evolve on its own, without deliberate constraints or direction.  Putting this kind of space into focus could be a helpful step in taking this problem more seriously.</p>

	<h1>Visual Storyboard</h1>
	<main>
		<div class='storyboard'>
			<h4>Overall Environment:</h4>
			<img src="overall.png" alt="Overall View" class="storyboard-image"></img>
			<ul>
				<li>World is rectangular 'park' with different environmental features</li>
				<li>Movement is influenced by terrain: i.e. deep snow is slower to move through</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>User View</h4>
			<img src="visibility.png" alt="User View" class="storyboard-image"></img>
			<ul>
				<li>Visibility is highly constrained - hard to understand overall map</li>
				<li>Need to use cues (in design and in other footprints) to find things</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Interactions</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Exits: Each direction "exits" to an external page - performing a navigation function (i.e. github, home, etc.)</li>
				<li>"Interactables": Objects or events that happen periodically, in response to user behavior, or even semi-randomly</li>
				<li>This could include animals moving around/acting, interesting "objects", periodic events, etc.</li>
			</ul>

				<h2><a href="https://terrycavanaghgames.com/constellationmachine/" target="_blank">Constellation Machine</a></h2>
			</div>
			<article>
				<p>Constellation Machine is an interactive environment or 'machine'.  It starts with a blank screen and a blinking text cursor, prompting the user to type.  There are no instructions, though if the user types ‘help', a series of suggestions begin to cycle in the top right corner.  As it turns out, the only possible user interaction is to type commands from a finite but unstated set.  Each command creates an effect of some kind.</p>

				<p>Some add objects that move and transform according to their own logic.  Some change the overall environment - the background color, the rotation, the visual effects.  Others are more conceptual: typing ‘game' adds a highscore to the top left.  As far as I can tell, there is nothing being 'scored'.  A command like 'freeze' stops all movement - it is left to the user to guess what might restart it again.  It is a space for exploration.</p>

				<p>That is its main point of relevance.  While the central mechanic of my project is simply walking around, this is hopefully made enticing by the possibility of rewarded exploration - small events or objects that pique the user's curiosity.  The starting point is largely blank, and requires user initiative to develop.  However, 'Constellation Machine' has no networked component (though it would be interesting if it did!), so there is no responsive evolution based on multiple user behavior.</p>

			<article>
				<p>This is a small multiplayer browser game where each user plays as a cat in a small shared world.  To start with, the available interactions are quite limited - you can move around and talk in the in-game chat.  The multiplayer logic is quite clever, however.  As any cat moves around, they broadcast messages - when someone enters the forest, or the cave, or the mushroom…  This in itself encourages exploration, however the interactions don't stop there.</p>

				<p>Players can learn new commands (in the chat), find items, as well as objects that hint at future interactions that are currently unavailable.  You can also turn (or, be turned) into a dog, which gives you a new goal of turning back into a cat and reduces all of your chats to 'woof woof woof'.  The game is, of course, not very serious.</p>

				<p>However, it is a good example of a small-scale evolving multiplayer environment, even without competitive stakes of any kind.  There is no real permanence - you are only influenced by what is happening at the moment, and playing it 'alone' removes a lot of the impact.  My project aims to be a much more indirect kind of interaction, but on a similar scale and with similar aims.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://thisissand.com/" target="_blank">This Is Sand</a></h2>
			</div>
			<article>
				<p>The user can create sand.  You can pick a color, and drop it where you like.  Physics is simulated, to some degree, with discrete particles that roll and heap together naturally.  The connection here is mostly visual, and the overall idea of an evolving space that can be only interacted with indirectly.  For example: you cannot simply create any pattern you want out of sand, you have to work within the constraints of the system.  It will naturally form certain shapes, and preventing that is largely beyond your control.</p>

				<p>My project replaces physics with abstracted social interaction.  It also emphasizes visuals less for their own sake, but the patterns of activity will likely be visually interesting.  But it is nevertheless about creating a lasting system using an imprecise tool, and then watching the mechanics of that system drive its evolution.</p>
